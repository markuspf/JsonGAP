# The GAP 4 package `JsonGAP'

These are functions that provide some JSON related functionality (similar to https://github.com/gap-packages/json),
but the functions are all implemented in pure GAP.

This is mainly for experimentation purposes or when you do not want to compile separate code. If you want full (and fast)
JSON support, you're better off with https://github.com/gap-packages/json.
